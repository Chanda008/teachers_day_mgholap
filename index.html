        <p>Happy Teachers Day ms, hope you have a wonderful day! From the 1st day in 5th I knew you would be my favourite teacher. You have made me gone through so much so easily. You are so humorous and always stay happy. I can remember most of our memories in 5B, our class play, the Rivers project and so much more! Shayaan and Yuvraj would always get your head on fire. I really wish to see you in school! Hope I made you smile while reading this. (P.S this picture was taken during a zoom class, sorry) </p>
